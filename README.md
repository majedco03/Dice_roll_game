# üé≤ Dice Roll Game ‚Äî Version 2

**Note:** This project is an **enhanced version of my original Dice Roll Game**, created as part of my journey learning Dart & Flutter.  
I built Version 2 **after completing the basics**, focusing on structured multi-screen navigation, turn-based gameplay, and a polished results system.

**Note:** Although Version 2 uses multiple screens (Home, Game Play, Results), the navigation is handled simply by calling the screen constructors on button presses. This approach allowed me to explore **basic multi-screen flow** without diving into advanced routing techniques.

Welcome to **Dice Roll Game V2**, a **complete redesign and major upgrade** to the classic dice game built with Flutter & Dart.  

This version isn‚Äôt just an update ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **reimagined experience**:  
from a single static screen into a **dynamic, multi-screen game** with clear win conditions, turn-based gameplay, and a polished results system.
